# Canvas Objects #

### Problem(s) ###

The available programming for Canvas tags is relatively limited. Those of us coming from a Flash background will quickly find canvas very limiting and, in truth, a huge step backwards. Some of the major limitations follow:

+ Inability to treat a drawn item as an object
+ Inability to natively move an object in an XY coordinate system (thus complicating animation)
+ Inability to layer scenes over-top of one another

Still, with all these limitations, there is a lot of tout that the canvas tag will kill Flash. For some reason, everyone is going along with this ideal despite the crippling lack of functionality. Welcome back to 1987. We hope you have enjoyed your stay.

### Solutions ###

As we are moving into an age where JavaScript will be needed to be compatible with all manner of peripheral devices such as phones and tablets, we need to beef up cabability in order to facilitate this change. Since it will take years of squabbling over needed standards, and even longer for certain browsers (you know who I am talking about) to to update changes, it falls on the developers to take action.

First order of business was to make everything ObjectOriented.
